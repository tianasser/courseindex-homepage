<h2> A Graphic Designer at OCAD University </h2>

<p class="new-class"> <strong> About me </strong> <P>As a Graphic Designer living in Toronto, I aim to to have balance between my educational life and social life. Although most times it is tough, I created a very detailed schedule that includes the hours of the day dedicated to studying and those dedicated to going out with friends or even just sitting at home and resting. Core classes such as Graphic Design 2 usually take up the most time thrpught my week. They are worth one whole credit and require constant work throughout the semester inorder to achieve.  </p>
<P> <strong> Graphic Design 2</strong> </P>
   
<p class="new-class"><p>In this course we will have around four assignments; Cofounding Tools, Parametrics and Generations, Me of the Screen, and Course Index. Each tackles a specific aspect of the course and helps us further achieve the goal of properly knowing how to code and familiarizing ourselves with the tools and platforms that help us do so. </P>

    <p><u>The first assignment;</u> Cofounding Tools, requires us to create a poster that portrays one of two things; our lives during Covid-19 or how we see the future of design without using softwares made for designing. This means that we cannot use any adobe platforms. Instead we should try to find ways to use other platforms such as phone games, social media apps, and others to create a piece of art depicting one of the topics.</p>
    <p><u>The second assignment;</u> Parametrics and Generation, we will be assigned one character that we would have to create a daily sketch of using coding for three weeks. This will help us better practice our skills and broaden our horizons on coding and graphic design.</p>
    <p><u>The third assignment;</u> The Me of the Screen, includes self-observation and documentation as design-based research and then combining our finidng s with two, three, or four dimensional spaces to create a dynamic piece.</p>
    <p><u>The fourth assignment;</u> Course Index, is a semester-long assignment that rewuires us to work on it throught the entire time of the course. The goal is to create a webiste that documents all our process, work, reflections, and finidngs throught the semester and this course. This will be done through the use of coding; HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p> </p>

<p class="new-class"></p> <strong> <u><mark><a href="https://canvascloud.ocadu.ca/courses/2882/modules">MODULES</a></mark></u> </strong> </ul</p>
<p> Modules are basically tasks that need to be completed by specific dates; usually before the first class of the week. Modules include readings, watching lectures, practicing our skills in the feilds we are learning about, and engaging in class discussions to get a better understanding of a subject and read other peoples opionions. </p>

<p id="circle"><strong> <u><mark><a href="Assignments/assignments.html">ASSIGNMENTS</a></mark></u> </strong></p>
<p> Assignments are the main projects that we complete throught the duration of the course. Assignments can be anything from creating a website, to creating a poster, or making models. Assignments usually take around three weeks to be completed and require a lot of time and effort. Our assignments usually reflect what we leared throught the course and the skills we develop from the activities we do in the modules on weekluy basis. </p>
<p id="circle"><strong> <u><mark><a href="Readings/readings.html">READINGS& DISCUSSIONS</a></mark></u> </strong></p>
<p> The readings in this course educate us on topics we discuss in class and then ask us to write written responses on questions related to the readings. This allows us to engage with one another as we would be able to read the different responses and have to comment on a couple of our peer's answers.
