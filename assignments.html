        Assignment 1 - Cofounding Tools
    </P>

    <p>
        The aim for this assignment was to design a 24"x36" poster using anything but digital design platforms such as adobe. The poster had to depic one of two things; how you see the future of design or your life under Covid-19. I chose the prompt relating to Covid-19 as I felt like I would be able to express myself better than if I used the other prompt. To realise this poster, I decided to use my macbook desktop to show the events that took place in my during Covid-19. I used screenshots of my pictures and the activities I took part in during that time and assembled them in my desktop. I split my poster into four categories; online learning, communication, reminicing, and passing time.
